# Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression Project

This project implements a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict housing prices using the popular **Housing Price Prediction** dataset from Kaggle. 
The project follows a professional, end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing & Encoding
- Multiple Linear Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Visualizations (Residual Plot, Actual vs Predicted Plot)
- Coefficient Interpretation for understanding feature impact


Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
[Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction))


Tools & Terchniques

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


Project Steps
1. Data Loading & Inspection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling Categorical Variables with One-Hot Encoding
4. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
5. Model Training using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
6. Model Evaluation:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared (R²)
7. Visualizations:
   - Correlation Heatmap
   - Residual Distribution Plot
   - Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
8. Interpretation of Model Coefficients

Conclusion

The project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be applied for real-world price prediction tasks, along with model evaluation and interpretation.
